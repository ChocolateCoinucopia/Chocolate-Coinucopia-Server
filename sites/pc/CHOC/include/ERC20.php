      Chocolate Coins are built on the ERC20+ standard. This means they are systematically decentralized. Like most decentralized cryptocurrencies, they trade freely on a decentralized network. Transactions are logged with super redundancy into the global blockchain in pseudo-anonymity. On the Ethereum network, all ERC20 tokens are compatible with this system, including Chocolate Coins. However, where the ERC20+ standard differs is that it is systematically decentralized.

    <p class="mw-10 justify">
      The ERC20+ standard uses an improved transaction logging system that allows a coin's entire financial system to exist within the decentralized network. From the moment of its creation, ICO, transactions, exchange trades, analysis, etc... all system-required information is available on the blockchain. While this concept is not new to ERC20 tokens in some regards (i.e., coin offerings and transactions), it is with other areas of the financial system (i.e., exchanges and analysis).

      The primary difference in ERC20+ is an advanced event logging protocol that offers better accessibility to front-end services. This protocol extends to the ancillary systems that manage market activities. The most notable of these is the decentralized exchange (a.k.a., "DEX" or the "Candy Shop"), which allows users to place and execute trade orders directly between one another. Trades are fairly and freely brokered by an algorithm embedded directly into the Ethereum blockchain, adding the safety a third-party broker provides without the third-party. In addition, the event logging performed by the DEX allows traders to stay informed on current price activity and historical trends without relying on outside sources.
    </p>

    <p class="mw-10 justify">
      One of the best examples of what the ERC20+ standard has to offer is this website, which has no backend. All the systems available on this website (the ICO sale, DEX, analysis tools, etc.) interface directly with the blockchain from a duplicatable node on a generic server, adding another layer of decntralization to the Ethereum network.
