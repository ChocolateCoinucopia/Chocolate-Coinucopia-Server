                In every transaction, the chocolate coin algorithm creates new coins for the spender that counteracts the loss of ETH associated with the transaction cost. In this way, every transaction is two transactions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p class="s-mw-10 justify">
                        The original transaction where Party A pays Party B Chocolate Coins for some consideration in return.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="s-mw-10 justify">
                        An automatic, ancillary transaction where the ETH transaction fee pays for the creation of new Chocolate Coins.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="s-mw-10 justify">
                Transaction rewards are recorded on the Ethereum network, and paid to an account when that account becomes the source of 100,000,000+ CHOC spent (or 1+ CC spent). This is the Chocolate Coin's "Bar" value, and prevents vexing feedback loops from affecting account balances.
